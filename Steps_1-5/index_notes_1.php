// Any code in a file that should be interpreted as php should start with this sequence

// To launch webpage to actively see your changes type this into terminal: 
// php -S localhost:8888

// Echo is a way of saying "print this to the screen" (webpage screen)
// Text inside quotations = string (basic text). Strings should always be inside quotes
// Semicolon (;) = Represents the end of a particular sequence or command 
//echo "Hello World";

// Create a variable by starting with $ plus any string
// make that variable equal to any value. In this case, it is a string. End with a semicolon. 
//$greeting = "Hello";

// Print the variable 
// echo $greeting;

// Create another variable to store your name 
//$name = "Ewa";

// Print both variables together using concatonation. Added punctuation and spaces. 
//echo $greeting, ", " . $name, "!";

//echo "$greeting, $name";
